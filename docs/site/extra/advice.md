========

some warnings about decisions made in language development, or remarks on important considerations.

Why the codacy was removed?
-----------------
codacity was removed for showing false positives in functions with variable parameter amounts.

Why the codecov was removed?
------------------
Codecov has a bad implementation to deal with calculating coverage coefficient in projects above 99.9% where adding and removing **comments** can trigger loss of coverage error.

 * see the old history here: <https://app.codecov.io/gh/RodrigoDornelles/3bc-lang>

Does the official website make an apology for Bolsonaro?
--------------------------------------------------------

**NOT!** :fist_raised:

The opposite, the founder of the language is a militant against the fascist government.

Brazilian flags buttons also green and yellow colors are to show pride in being a national technology like [Lua](https://lua.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

Is a way of protest against the distorted values of our nationalism.
