## About project ##

| Common questions | answer |
| :--------------- | :----- |
| What is the purpose of the language? | the idea is to be a low level, simple and intuitive language that anyone can learn! (and that can even be read on punched cards) |
| Do you need knowledge of **C** to understand 3BC? | No, they have different syntaxes |
| What is the language's typing level ? | There is no distinction of types, they are just data |
| Does it have garbage collector? | No, the developer has full control over the memory, this follows the same philosophy as **C** "freedom with responsibility" |
| Does it work as a compiler? | No, it currently works as an interpreter (although a very fast one), or also by packaging bytecode with a vm in a single binary. |
| What are the influences? | Languages **Cobol**, **Ruby** and **Java**; AssemblyÂ´s **WASM**, **ARM** and **x86** |
| Is it more compact than **Lua**? | Yeah, because it has the same performance target as the Arduino Uno microcontroller. And this impacts it's size (depending on the CPU's architecture, 14KiB ROM and 400 bytes RAM ) |
