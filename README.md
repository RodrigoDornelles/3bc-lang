## How to build ##

Download interpreter **source code** and manually compile from scratch.

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/RodrigoDornelles/3bc-lang
cmake .
make
```

## How to install ##

Directly download interpreter as **executable** command for mac/linux/bsd.

```BASH
sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RodrigoDornelles/3bc-lang/master/scripts/install_vm.sh || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RodrigoDornelles/3bc-lang/master/scripts/install_vm.sh)"
```
